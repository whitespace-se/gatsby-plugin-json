# gatsby-plugin-json

Create a json file (or multiple files) for your Gatsby site. 
## Install

`npm install gatsby-plugin-json` or `yarn add gatsby-plugin-json`

## How to Use

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-json`,
      options: {
        files: [
           {
            output: "/packages.json",
            serialize: ({ matomoPlugin, wordpressPlugin }) => {
              const packages = {}
              matomoPlugin.nodes.forEach(function (node) {
                packages[node.name] = node
              })
              matomoPlugin.nodes.forEach(function (node) {
                packages[node.name] = node
              })
              return { packages }
            },
            query: `
          {
            matomoPlugin: allMatomoPlugin(sort: { order: DESC, fields: lastUpdated }) {
              nodes {
                id
                idPath
                type
                versions {
                  download
                  release
                }
              }
            }
            wordpressPlugin: allWordpressPlugin(sort: { order: DESC, fields: lastUpdated }) {
              nodes {
                id
                idPath
                type
                versions {
                  download
                  release
                }
              }
            }
          }
          `,
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Each file must include `output` and `query`. Additionally, it is strongly recommended to pass a custom `serialize` function, otherwise an internal serialize function will be used which may not exactly match your particular use case.

_NOTE: This plugin only generates the `json` file(s) when run in `production` mode! To test your feed, run: `gatsby build && gatsby serve`._
